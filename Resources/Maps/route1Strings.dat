Hi! I work at a Pokemon Mart.
It's a convenient shop, so
please visit us in Viridian
City. I know, I'll give you a
sample! Here you go!
You have too much stuff with
you!
We also carry Pokeballs for
catching Pokemon!
See those ledges along the
road? It's a bit scary, but you
can jump from them. You can get
back to Pallet Town quicker
that way.
Trainer battle test!
Test over!
